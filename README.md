# Calculator
This is de Calculator project we made in Java using the IDE Eclipse for coding it. The functions the calculator can do are in methods so it's easy to call. All methods atleast one parameter and the method returns the answer.

#### Square
To get the square of a number I used the multiply method to multiply the number by itself.
```Java
	public static int square(int number1) {
		// HINT: multiply???
		int resultaat = number1;
		
		resultaat = multiply(number1,number1);
		
		return resultaat;
	}

```
